Recommendations

1.  Market Strategies:

    -   Leading brands (Toyota, Volkswagen, Fiat) should maintain their focus on affordable and versatile models (sedans, pick-ups).

    -   Brands with lower participation (Ford, Chevrolet) may need to adjust their offerings to regain market share.

2.  Segmentation:

    -   The concentration of owners in Buenos Aires and CABA suggests marketing and distribution strategies should prioritize these areas.

    -   Given the entry of younger buyers, brands could develop campaigns targeting this segment, highlighting technology, design, and efficiency.

3.  Production and Import:

    -   The growing share of Protocol 21 cars could be an opportunity to diversify offerings, but national brands must remain competitive in price and quality.

4.  Future Analysis:

    -   Incorporating economic data (inflation, GDP, interest rates) would help better understand sales fluctuations.

    -   A more detailed analysis by car model could reveal specific consumer preferences.

Appendix: Methodological Notes

-   Data: The data comes from car registrations between 2019 and 2024, with columns such as initial registration date, vehicle brand description, owner birth year, owner gender, vehicle origin, usage type, and province.

-   Filtering:

    -   Records with "Not applicable" or "Not identified" gender were excluded for age analysis.

    -   Ages were calculated as Year - owner_birth_year and filtered to include only values between 18 and 100 years. Since only the birth year was used, there is an error margin of up to one year in ages.

-   Definitions:

    -   Protocol 21 refers to the import of cars from Mercosur countries under specific trade agreements.

-   Limitations:

    -   The "Not applicable" gender category includes legal entities, which may bias demographic analysis.

    -   External economic factors that could explain sales fluctuations were not included.
